Our animalistic alien species is stronger and faster than most average humans, but trades this for fewer starting XP. The physical appearance of this species is, of course, up to you.',

        'description' => "The average human archetype is our baseline for character creation, and portrays the most customizable example of a person. You should choose this archetype if you prefer to play 'generalist' characters, who are never going to be terrible at anything. You should also choose this archetype if you have a very specific type of character in mind, since this archetype has the most customization options of the four choices. The characteristics all start at 2, meaning your character is going to have a hard time increasing any one characteristic to a 4 or 5, but also that your character isn't going to have any characteristic they are truly lacking in. Likewise, the strain and wound thresholds start at the average 10. Your character starts with more ranks in skills than anyone else, again playing to the idea of being a generalist. Your archetype ability is also a generalist ability. Effectively, your group gains a Story Point to spend whenever it needs it. And finally, your character starts with the most experience of any of the four archetypes. Just remember, character creation is your only chance to spend XP on characteristics (otherwise, to increase a characteristic you need to purchase the Dedication talent; see page 81). We recommend you spend most of these XP on improving your characteristics, while saving at most 25â€“35 experience for talents and skills.",
